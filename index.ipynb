    "Decentralized auctions, under homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation \n",
    "============\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to provide a prototype illustrating how homomorphic encryption would allow mechanism design schemes that do not rely on the \"mythical central planner\". **For instance - auctions ran without an auctioneer acting as trusting third party, but organized by the participating parties themselves** (one can then use such a decentralized auction to automate and improve OTC auctions like those operating under BWIC - \"bids wanted in competition\" - which are prone to conflicts and misreporting; *see for instance \"Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada v. Saba Capital Management\"*).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The auction simulation in this notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an illustration of a decentralized auction, which you can run with some of your friends or family members (for now if they are physically located close to you - sorry for the lockdown !). Indeed section 2. below provides a section with hideable cells which each one of you can use to enter his bid. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make things more realistic a real (virtual) good can be put on sale here : some of you might indeed know of the blog full of articles on random topics that I have - https://medium.com/@nicolaszhang -, however you couldn't know that there are many \"unlisted\" articles there that no one without the link can see (see screenshot below).\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen%20Shot%202020-05-27%20at207.24.12%20AM.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A pseudo real life auction will then consist in \"selling\" one of these \"unlisted\" articles, whose value will be for you (and your friends) to decide. The last section here will offer different auction schemes for this sell, and once you and your friends will decide to participate in, the final winning bidder will be automatically sent a Venmo request with the value of the winning bid. Upon completion of the online transaction the link of the \"unlisted\" article will be sent to him. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis will be that the different auction schemes will lead to different winning bids (even among the same players).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The homomorphic encryption scheme used here \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homomorphic encryption refers to a kind of encryption in which some computation on ciphertexts produces an encryption of the desired computation on the plaintexts** (i.e. f(Enc(messages)) = Enc(f(messages)), in which f can be additive, multiplicative, or more sophisticated functions). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Paillier encryption scheme used here is for instance homomorphic over the operation of addition. **Namely, given pk, Enc(pk, m1), Enc(pk, m2) one can efficiently compute Enc(pk, m1 + m2)**. *(see Paillier, Pascal (1999). \"Public-Key Cryptosystems Based on Composite Degree Residuosity Classes\". EUROCRYPT. Springer. pp. 223–238. doi:10.1007/3-540-48910-X_16)*\n",
